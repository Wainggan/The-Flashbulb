was inspired by everything here, so I decided to give my own spin on this one

going to be completely honest I have no idea what I'm doing here lmao
I have like no experience producing music please forgive me

## notes

in the interest of keeping the repository size down, I won't keep renders or large stems here, instead I'll upload them to a file service (probably file garden), and they will linked here (because I'm too incompetent to set up one of those git large file managing things).

90% sure all of the samples I'm using is royalty free, but I'm also pretty sure I don't have to rights to redistribute them so as a precaution I'm gitignoring any I didn't make. I'll link to where I got any samples when relevant. 

otherwise,
- `1.wav` is a drum loop I made
- `shake1.wav`, `h1-2.wav`, `snap1-2.wav`, and `snare1-1` are various bits of percussion I made
- everything else is just whatever
